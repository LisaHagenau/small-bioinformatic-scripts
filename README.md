# A collection of small scripts dealing with problems of a bioinformatic nature

## multifasta.py
Creates a fasta file from files containing sequencing data (e.g. .seq files), using the filename as fasta header. Copy the script to the folder containing the sequencing files and run it. If your files have a different extension, change the file extension in line 10. Inspired by a question on r/bioinformatics.
